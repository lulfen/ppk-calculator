Ulfen's PPK-Calculator
Made in python 3.5.2

This is a project that had two different purposes:
1 - me learning how to work with both python and GitHub
2 - calculating which punsch gives you the most punsch per Swedish Krona. For those of you who don't know about this beautiful, golden liquor, it's a kind of liqour that is popular in Sweden (and parts of Finland), especially among students. It's a pretty sweet drink made primarily on arrak.

--- INSTALL ---

1. run setup.sh
2. make sure you have all the listed packages installed
3. run ppk-calculator.py

--- USAGE ---

1. simply run "python3 ppk-calculator.py" after running setup
2. navigate through the menus by typing "number" + "ENTER"
3. enjoy your cheap punsch!

--- FUTURE UPDATES ---

- more generic usage instead of only focusing on Punsch
- incorporate downloading in the python file
- maybe tweak the interface
- got an idea what should go here? Let me know!
