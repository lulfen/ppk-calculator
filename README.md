Ulfen's PPK-Calculator
Made in python 3.5.2


This is a project that had two different purposes:
1 - me learning how to work with both python and GitHub
2 - calculating which punsch gives you the most punsch per Swedish Krona. For those of you who don't know about this beautiful, golden liquor, it's a kind of liqour that is popular in Sweden (and parts of Finland), especially among students. It's a pretty sweet drink made primarily on arrak.

Right now this project is a mess. Sorry. I got several snippets of actually useful code split over multiple files. Right now I'm trying to consolidate them all into one single .py file. I'm also considering completely removing the punsch.log part of this project, although I do like the idea of having a text file to help different parts of the project communicating with each other.

It's starting to come together! In version alpha 0.1 I added downloading of data and all of the different parts of the program is consolidated to one single file.
work remaining:
     - cleanup code
     - check setup properly
     - make complete list of which modules are needed for it to run properly

After completing this I'm considering turning it into a more general search utility for the sortiment of the Swedish Systembolaget (govermental monopoly on alcohol).
